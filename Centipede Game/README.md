# Centipede SFML Game

This is a recreation of the first level of Centipede completed as a lab in Advanced Programming Techniques. This project was completed over a 3 week timeline. <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Beginning-Cpp-Game-Programming-Second-Edition">Beginning C++ Game Programming - Second Edition</a> was provided as a reference, but all work done on the game was completely independent.

All code besides the starter code for the CMake file was written by me. All assets were provided by the professor.

## How to build/run
1. Ensure CMake is installed on your machine and that the terminal is running Linux (or WSL)
2. If the game is not yet built, run `./build_and_run.sh` from the same folder as this README
3. If the game has previously been built, run `./run.sh` from the same folder as this README
